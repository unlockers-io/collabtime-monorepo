Your job is to make collab time a real time collaboration tool, that is easy to use and helps users to find the best time with their teams.

The platform currently lost its power to show real time updates with the upstash realtime, that was working before, but is not working now.

We also should add more ways for the user to customize the platform, change the password of the team, and maybe add more features to the platform, for PRO users, so the PRO is more attractive.

Make a commit and push your changes after every single file edit.

Use the .agent/ directory as a scratchpad for your work. Store long term plans and todo lists there.

The app should have tests, and should be tested by you using the playwriter mcp.
